# # Python Identifiers
# A Python identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, class, module or other object.
# Python Class names start with an uppercase letter. All other identifiers start with a lowercase letter.
# Starting an identifier with a single leading underscore indicates that the identifier is private identifier.
# Starting an identifier with two leading underscores indicates a strongly private identifier.
# If the identifier also ends with two trailing underscores, the identifier is a language-defined special name.
