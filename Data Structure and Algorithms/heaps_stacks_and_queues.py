# # Heaps Stacks and Queues
print("""The purpose of a min-heap is to store objects that have a partial
      order on them. It has a fast (O(log n)) method for removing the 
      minimum object from the heap. Min-heaps are useful for calculations 
      where you have multiple minimum computations to perform.\nThere is 
      an analogous structure called a max-heap, which extracts the maximum 
      value from the heap.\nA heap is either a max-heap or a min-heap - 
      it can't be both. Given an implementation of a min-heap, a max-heap 
      can be implemented by reversing the comparison between elements.""")
