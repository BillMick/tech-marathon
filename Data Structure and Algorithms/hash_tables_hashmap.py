      structure that maps keys to its value pairs (implement abstract array
      data types). It basically makes use of a function that computes an
      index value that in turn holds the elements to be searched, inserted,
      removed, etc. This makes it easy and fast to access data. In general,
      hash tables store key-value pairs and the key is generated using a 
      hash function.""")
